# Foxclient server

Primitive version of soon to be a plugin that will connect [FoxClient](https://github.com/FoxStudios/FoxClient) with a server.

## Current features:
- Custom Join/Quit messages

## Planned features:
- Client-Server connection
- Turn features of FoxClient off/on (through server-side config)
- maybe more commands
- possibly server-side friend system that integrates with FoxClient


### Known issues:
- Join/Quit messages are double (minecraft native and plugin join/quit messages both show)
